                <h3>Maintenace and stability</h3>
                <p class="two">A stiff shoe has at least the advantage of being stable. Especially when it is designed with a wide front, as is the case here. Changes of direction and receptions are therefore very well controlled. Reinforcements on the stem also help to hold the foot.</p>

                <p class="two">At the back, we see that this shoe was designed for a player who wears pegs. Except that it is not our case. The foot is not tight in the heel. It's wide and at first it seems to float a little too much. It has not been a problem for security, and we end up doing it. But it's a bit confusing at first.

                In the end, the shoe is reassuring.</p>

            <p class="three">The Curry 6 is reserved for a specific target: players who want the grip, little cushioning and a stable shoe. Players at the Stephen Curry. Logic.

            For Sunday players looking for a versatile option or who want comfort above all else, look elsewhere.</p>
            <p class="three">Again, a constant. But in the positive. Under Armor has the habit of offering a good grip, and it is still the case with this Curry 6. Even with dust, it was not taken in default.</p>
